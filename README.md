## Project Azure - App Service

> Microsoft Azure, commonly referred to as Azure, is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and 
> managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.
> Many Services are being hosted by Microsoft Azure.

Azure App Service is one of the featured service.

> Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice 
> without managing infrastructure. It offers auto-scaling and high availability, supports both Windows and Linux, and enables automated 
> deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo.
> Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your 
> favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and 
> Linux-based environments.
